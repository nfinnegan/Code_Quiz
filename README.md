# Code_Quiz

## Project Overview

In this project I was tasked with creating a Code Quiz from scratch. The code incorporates the JS learned in week 3 along with additional aspects of week 4's learning which involved a lot of adding/creating/manipulating elements dynamically.

## Description

In the 4th week of bootcamp we spent our time learning how to use Web APIs in order to unlock some of JavaScript's potential to interact with a user dynamically versus through a static file. This homework assignment overlaps with week 5 learnings so there is some jQuery sprinkled in.

## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Technologies Used
